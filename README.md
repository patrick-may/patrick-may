# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Patrick!
I am a typical computer nerd, with both interests and employement in the technology sector. I worked for WebstaurantStore doing Quality Assurance Automation and am now transitioning to a new graduate developer role at BNY Mellon, starting in august.

My personal interests lie in programming languages, developer experience, and program analysis (although I am taking a solid break from this after completing my [undergraduate thesis](https://patrick-may.github.io/projects/Static-Energy-Analysis-Thesis/))

Always open to discuss things -- if you believe a junior dev can have valuable insights. Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn to connect! A lot of the things touched on in brief can be found in longer prose on my website [here](https://patrick-may.github.io).
